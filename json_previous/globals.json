In fact, current doctrine highly recommends fighting in groups as the best way to quickly level and equip tanks, as the mere presence of a tank near an enemy kill qualifies the pilot for drops.

Thus, if a tank of level 19 or lower is destroyed, any symbiotes it had will continue to provide bonuses to the pilot's next tank of that class.
